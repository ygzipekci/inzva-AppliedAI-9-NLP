Hello everyone, welcome to the first of two lab sessions of NLP weeks.

In this week's notebook I aim to materialize some of the concepts that were discussed during Karahan's session.
I will use this one notebook for the entire session. It includes some problem solving and some not-too-deep theory. 
I tried to write the main points that I will talk about around the cells and I will also be supporting those with anecdotes from my experience in the industry.
I encourage you to take a look at the notebook, read it, run it top to bottom and try your best to solve the exercises. 
I also encourage you to go beyond the exercises and try to apply whatever methods you are curious about on those problems. 
It doesn't matter how succesful you are at solving the exercises. Feel free to experiment so we can discuss those during the session.

If you have any issues with running the notebook or setting up the environment feel free to reach out to me anytime and I will help you get it running.
I hope you enjoy the notebook and come up with many many questions.
See you on Thursday ðŸ¤—
