Hello everyone, welcome to the second and last lab session of NLP weeks.

In this week's notebook I aim to demystify RAG systems and LLMs in general

similar to last week;
I will use this one notebook for the entire session. It includes some problem solving and some not-too-deep theory.
I tried to write the main points that I will talk about around the cells and I will also be supporting those with anecdotes from my experience in the industry.
I encourage you to take a look at the notebook, read it, run it and perform some experiments on the introduced topics
If the experiment tracking part feels a bit limiting, you don't have to use it, you can benchmark your experiments however you like
It doesn't matter how succesful you are at solving the exercises or at the benchmarks. Feel free to experiment so we can discuss those during the session.

If you have any issues with running the notebook or setting up the environment feel free to reach out to me anytime and I will help you get it running.
I hope you enjoy the notebook and come up with many many questions.
I also hope you can reuse some of the code for your other projects :)
See you on Thursday ðŸ¤—
